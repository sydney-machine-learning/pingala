# pingala 

Pingala is a Python based machine learning software library that features Bayesian inference for deep learning and geoscientific models via MCMC

It is named after "Pingala" - to pay tribute to ancient Hindu scientist, who invented the binary number system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingala

### Features
* MCMC (sequential and parallel implementation)
* Parallel tempering MCMC for statistical models
* Parallel tempering MCMC for  neural networks: 1. FNN, 2. RNN, 3. LSTM, 4. GRU
* Parallel tempering MCMC for geoscientific models - Badlands lansacpe evolution models
* Parallel tempering MCMC for geoscieentific models - pyReef-Core evolution models
